The test measures whether the average (expected) value differs significantly across samples. If we observe a large p-value, for example larger than 0.05 or 0.1, then we cannot reject the null hypothesis of identical average scores. If the p-value is smaller than the threshold, e.g. 1%, 5% or 10%, then we reject the null hypothesis of equal averages.", "ALG_CREATOR": "Anita Graser", "field1": "Attribute of layer1 containing the values for the first sample.", "layer1": "The layer containing the first attribute which should be used for the test.", "t_test_results": "An HTLM file with the t-statistic and p-value results of the T-test.", "field2": "Attribute of layer2 containing the values for the second sample.", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Anita Graser"}
