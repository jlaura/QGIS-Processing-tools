{"ALG_DESC": "Moran\u2019s I measures the global spatial autocorrelation in an attribute y measured over n spatial units.\n\nWhen the variable of interest is rates based on populations with different sizes, the Moran\u2019s I value needs to be adjusted to account for the differences among populations. To apply this adjustment, we can create an instance of the Moran_Rate class rather than the Moran class.\n\nResults are printed to the Python Console.\n\nOnline docs: http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/tutorials/autocorrelation.html#moran-s-i", "population_field": "population ", "ALG_CREATOR": "Anita Graser", "contiguity": "Define if queen or rook contiguity should be used to compute the weights.", "field": "The field of the input layer which contains the values which should be analyized for clusters.", "ALG_VERSION": "Anita Graser", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Anita Graser", "input": "The polygon vector layer which should be analyzed.
