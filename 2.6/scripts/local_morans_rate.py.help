{"ALG_DESC": "Local Moran's I measures local autocorrelation quantitatively which results in n values of local spatial autocorrelation, one for each spatial unit.\n\nWhen the variable of interest is rates based on populations with different sizes, the Moran\u2019s I value needs to be adjusted to account for the differences among populations. To apply this adjustment, we can create an instance of the Moran_Local_Rate class rather than the Moran_Local class.\n\nOnline docs: http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/tutorials/autocorrelation.html#local-moran-s-i", "population_field": "population", "ALG_CREATOR": "Anita Graser", "contiguity": "Define if queen or rook contiguity should be used to compute the weights.", "field": "The field of the input layer which contains the values which should be analyized for clusters.", "ALG_VERSION": "", "ALG_HELP_CREATOR": "Anita Graser", "morans_output": "The script outputs a polygon vector layer containing the original input features but appended by p-values MORAN_P and scatter plot quadrants \n\nMORAN_Q values indicate quadrat location 1 HH,  2 LH,  3 LL,  4 HL\n(github.com/pysal/pysal/blob/master/pysal/esda/moran.py)\n\ncategory - scatter plot quadrant - autocorrelation - interpretation\nhigh-high - upper right (red) - positive - Cluster - \"I'm high and my neighbors are high.\"\nhigh-low - lower right (pink) - negative - Outlier - \"I'm a high outlier among low neighbors.\"\nlow-low - lower left (med. blue) - positive - Cluster - \"I'm low and my neighbors are low.\"\nlow-high - upper left (light blue) - negative - Outlier - \"I'm a low outlier among high neighbors.\"\n(http://www.biomedware.com/files/documentation/spacestat/Statistics/LM/Results/Interpreting_univariate_Local_Moran_statistics.htm)", "input": "The polygon vector layer which should be analyzed.
